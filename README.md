## Features

-   **Mobile & Desktop**: Works on iOS, Android, and all desktop platforms

## How It Works

The plugin understands the meaning behind your content, not just keywords. As you write, it shows the 5 most similar notes at the bottom of your current note, excluding already-linked notes.

## Getting Started

1. Install the plugin
2. The default model will download automatically (one-time, ~30MB)
3. Your notes will be indexed in the background
4. Similar notes will appear at the bottom of your current note

Progress appears in the status bar.
